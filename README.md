# Windows Kernel Development Resources

# Windows Driver Kit (WDK)

The Windows Driver Kit is the cornerstone of kernel development on Windows. This toolkit includes:

- Driver templates
- Build environments
- Debugging tools
- Documentation
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk

For Windows 11 development, use Visual Studio 2022 and WDK 11.
